                <h4>About The Author</h4>
                <p>
                    (October 17, 1915 – February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist and screenwriter in the 20th-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953), and A View from the Bridge (1955). He wrote several screenplays, including The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman is considered one of the best American plays of the 20th century.<br><br>
                    Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. During this time, he received a Pulitzer Prize for Drama, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, and married Marilyn Monroe. In 1980, he received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. He received the Praemium Imperiale prize in 2001, the Prince of Asturias Award in 2002, and the Jerusalem Prize in 2003, and the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize in 1999.

                <h4>About The Book</h4>
                <p>
                    In the movies, I hate it when people yell at each other and fight all the time. I hate those scenes. Quite frankly, that's what makes up most of the acts in Death of a Salesman, and worse, it contains people who fight all the time and yet couldn't understand each other. It's like fighting with a crazy person. Willie Loman isn't right in the head (I guess it's safe to assume that)—he has unrealistic expectations of his sons, especially the eldest, Biff. He raised Biff as if he could walk in through any office in the city and would be granted CEO. And so when Biff was truly launched into the real world (after failing math, god help him), he had the same egoistical, unrealistically high opinions of himself that he never held down a job and thus never succeeded in life as his father taught him he would. He became spiteful because of this.<br><br>
                    All the fighting is indeed tedious. It's like all this racket inside my head, all these misunderstandings that could easily be solved only if people would just stop yelling and jumping to conclusions and start getting off their high horses. But the reason I gave this four stars is because of the heart-tugging symbolisms. The stockings got me. The stockings! And Linda's speech at the very end, oh my God, touched me in various places of my often-cold heart. It wasn't just the story of a salesman who's down on his luck, it's about what being a wife of one is like, too. She's the ideal mother and wife, someone who sticks through thick and thin and husband's lunacy. I feel abundantly sorry for her. This is for Linda.

                        Many of my friends recommended me this book, therefore, I finally decided to give it a read. Unfortunately, there aren't any book shops around where I live so this website proved to be of a great help. I was easily able to access this book. Thank you so much!
