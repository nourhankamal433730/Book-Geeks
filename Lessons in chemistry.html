                <h4>About The Author</h4>
                <p>
                    (born April 18, 1957 in Riverside, California) is an American author and former copywriter.<br><br>
                    Garmus is from Seattle. She received her bachelors in creative writing/aesthetic studies from UC Santa Cruz. She's worked as a copywriter and creative director in the US, and has lived in Switzerland and Colombia.<br><br>
                    In April 2022, her debut novel, Lessons in Chemistry, was published. The Guardian noted its "polished, funny, thought-provoking story ... it's hard to believe it's a debut". The New York Times commented on its "entertaining subplots and witty dialogue". Olimpia Mamula Steiner, a professor of chemistry, praised the book profusely:<br><br>
                    Once you start it will be difficult to put down, as soon as you finish a chapter you immediately want to read the next one, it's almost addictive.<br><br>
                    As of January 2022, Lessons in Chemistry had been sold into 35 territories and has a television adaptation in production at Apple TV+ starring Brie Larson. Éditions Robert Laffont published in May 2022 a French translation under the title La Brillante destinée d'Elizabeth Zott. The book was shortlisted for the 2023 RSL Christopher Bland Prize.<br><br>
                    Garmus is married, with two daughters, and lives in London. She enjoys open water swimming and has rowed competitively.

                <h4>About The Book</h4>
                <p>
                    Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize-nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results.<br><br>
                    But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo.<br><br>
                    Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.

                        Many of my friends recommended me this book, therefore, I finally decided to give it a read. Unfortunately, there aren't any book shops around where I live so this website proved to be of a great help. I was easily able to access this book. Thank you so much!
